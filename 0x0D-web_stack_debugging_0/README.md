# 0x0D. Web Stack Debugging #0

## Description

This project involves debugging a Docker container to ensure Apache is running and correctly serving a web page containing "Hello Holberton". You will learn about Docker, web servers, and basic debugging techniques.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Docker
- Basic knowledge of Bash scripting

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error
- Bash scripts must run without error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

## Setup Docker Environment

To run the Docker container provided for this task:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
```

## Debugging Steps

Follow these steps to debug the Docker container and get Apache running:

1. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
    ```

2. **Check the running container:**

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

3. **Connect to the running container:**

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
    ```

4. **Install Apache if not already installed and start the service:**

    ```bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y apache2
    service apache2 start
    ```

5. **Create the web page that should be served:**

    ```bash
    echo "Hello Holberton" > /var/www/html/index.html
    ```

6. **Verify that the Apache server is running and serving the correct page:**

    ```bash
    curl 0:80
    ```

You should see `Hello Holberton` as the output.

## Commands to Fix the Issue

Here are the commands you need to fix the issue. Save these in a Bash script (`0-give_me_a_page`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fix Apache to serve Hello Holberton

apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2
echo "Hello Holberton" > /var/www/html/index.html
service apache2 start
```

### Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x 0-give_me_a_page
```

### Run the Script

```bash
./0-give_me_a_page
```
